# Useless LED Chaos 

Welcome to the most **pointless Arduino project** you'll ever see. Seriously. Pins 2, 3, 4 blink randomly while the built-in LED on pin 13 decides to do its own chaotic thing. The serial monitor endlessly screams nonsense. If you were looking for purposeâ€¦ youâ€™re out of luck ðŸ˜ŽðŸ« .

## Features

- Pins **2, 3, 4** blink randomly with absolutely no pattern.
- Built-in LED on **pin 13** joins the chaos independently.
- Serial monitor spams `"I am useless ðŸ« ðŸ’€"` forever.
- Fully public domain, because why not? Spread the chaos! ðŸ”¥

## Requirements

- Arduino Uno (clones totally fine)  
- USB cable (avoid cheap power-only cables, theyâ€™re evil)  
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer  

---

## Usage

1. Plug in your Uno clone.  
2. Open Arduino IDE.  
3. Open `useless_led_chaos.ino`.  
4. Select **Board â†’ Arduino Uno**.  
5. Select the correct **Port**.  
6. Hit **Upload** and watch chaos unfold.

## Bonus

Feel free to add more LEDs, change pins, or make the chaos even more chaotic. Thereâ€™s no wrong way to be useless.
